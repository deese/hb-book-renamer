## Humble Bundle Book renamer

This small script reads books from a folder in the Humble bundle format (without any spaces) and tries to retrieve the title using the metadata.

It provides a text-based selection menu to select the title or enter a custom one.

The script has been tested only with a few number of files (like 5 or 6 bundles) so it may have errors, feel free to PR or send issues :D

Setup
=====

Run the following command to install dependencies:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```


usage:
```   hb-book-renamer.py <folder> ```

Tested on Linux and Windows using Python 3.12.
